# LLMs for Mining Misconceptions in Mathematics

This repository is dedicated to the Kaggle competition Eedi - Mining Misconceptions in Mathematics. 

In this competition, your task is to build an NLP model powered by machine learning to accurately predict the relationship between misconceptions and incorrect answers (distractors) in multiple-choice questions. The goal is to assist expert educators by generating candidate misconceptions for distractors, simplifying the process of linking them to specific misconceptions.
